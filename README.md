In this project, I researched chemical reaction networks (CRNs) for molecular programming, focusing on their practical application in heartbeat monitoring. 
CRNs, being a type of analog programming language for nanotechnology, hold immense potential, including their utilization as analog watchdog timers (WDT) 
for monitoring heartbeats and detecting cardiac arrest. To model these CRNs, I employed the chemistry-based programming language called Kaemika. This versatile 
language not only facilitated the interpretation of complex chemical reaction equations but also enabled the integration of ordinary differential equations to 
analyze the dynamic changes in chemical concentrations over time. The challenges encountered during this project were two-fold. Firstly, I faced the task of 
mastering a new and intricate computer language, Kaemika, which demanded dedicated efforts to understand its intricacies thoroughly. This initial learning curve 
was essential for effectively applying the language to the project's goals. Secondly, simulating heartbeats using ordinary differential equations presented 
another significant challenge. Accurately representing the intricate dynamics of heartbeats through mathematical models required precision making it a complex 
yet rewarding aspect of the research. Despite these challenges, my commitment and determination drove me to successfully navigate through the project's 
intricacies. As a result, I was able to unlock valuable insights into molecular programming, bringing us closer to harnessing the potential of CRNs for practical
and life-saving applications like heartbeat monitoring. Overall, this research not only expanded my knowledge and expertise in molecular programming but also 
showcased my ability to tackle complex scientific problems.
